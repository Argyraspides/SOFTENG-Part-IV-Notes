SoC, or "System on a Chip", is essentially just an entire system (implying many different functionalities and hence components) that are integrated into a single chip. An example would be Apple's M-series processors, which includes a CPU, GPU, RAM and Storage controllers, I/O controllers, and more (all of these being core components of a device we would refer to as a computer). Of course, apart from SoC's that incorporate most of the functionality of a computer, SoC's can be anything at all (hence why it is called **SYSTEM** on ***A*** **CHIP**). Another example of an SoC would be those inside of modern vehicles for their GPS systems which may have a dedicated SoC that incorporates all kinds of GPS functionality.

Below is an example of a GPS SoC, which is a single chip that can perform a wide variety of GPS related tasks, including GPS receiving, transmission, data parsing, and more.
