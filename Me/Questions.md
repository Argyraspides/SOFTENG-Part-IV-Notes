I sometimes see/read YouTube videos/shorts, Instagram Reels, regurgitated TikToks, blogs, articles, Reddit posts, and more, of people expressing very extreme opinions, thoughts, ideas, or beliefs. No matter how agregious or incorrect they may be, I always manage to find a breath of truth in the crux of what they're saying. 

I sometimes get reminded of migratory birds adjusting their path based on the trajectory of their neighbors, such that their net heading is indeed leading them to the correct destination. 

Could it be that our collective opinions are the same?
