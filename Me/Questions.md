I sometimes see/read YouTube videos/shorts, Instagram Reels, regurgitated TikToks, blogs, articles, Reddit posts, and more, of people expressing very extreme opinions, thoughts, ideas, or beliefs. No matter how agregious or incorrect they may be, I always manage to find a breath of truth in the crux of what they're saying. 

I sometimes get reminded of migratory birds adjusting their path based on the trajectory of their neighbors, such that their net heading is indeed leading them to the correct destination. 

Could it be that our collective opinions are the same?

*Nature tends towards equilibrium.* 

*Heat energy flows from high to low, stopping once the energy is equal.*
*Areas of high pressure always flow into areas of low pressure, stopping once the pressure is equal.*
*When acted upon by a force, an object will exert an equal force back.*

*An economy always goes through cycles of booms and depressions.*
*In an undisturbed ecosystem, there will come a time when a perfect balance is struck between predator and prey.*
*In an undisturbed society, culture eventually stagnates.*

*When we are alive, we must eventually die.*

*In a closed system, all things will stabilize.*

*Is it a fact, then, that there is no such thing as progress?*
