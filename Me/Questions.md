I sometimes see/read YouTube videos/shorts, Instagram Reels, regurgitated TikToks, blogs, articles, Reddit posts, and more, of people expressing very extreme opinions, thoughts, ideas, or beliefs. No matter how agregious or incorrect they may be, I always manage to find a breath of truth in the crux of what they're saying. 

I sometimes get reminded of migratory birds adjusting their path based on the trajectory of their neighbors, such that their net heading is indeed leading them to the correct destination. 

Could it be that our collective opinions are the same?

I don't know.

*When we are alive, we must eventually die.*

*In a closed system, all things will stabilize.*

*Is it a fact, then, that there is no such thing as progress? That there is only change?*

You often hear that when in love, you don't see the person as they are -- but as you want them to be. You see the ideal person, not the person that they are.

Investors are drooling at the mouth for AI *could* be, the hopes and dreams of some mystical, magical brain that does everything for us. No plan in sight on integration, on testing, on validity, on limitations, on anything, or what good it really is. No considerations on what evils it may cause -- as all things in the world do.

Is this hype just infatuation? The world in love for an impossible dream?

I think yes.

Over the course of human history, we have devised tools to help us.

Sometimes, these tools, while they do solve a problem, require us to forego the skills that once helped us solve that particular problem.

An example recently, I am now (sometimes) using an LLM search engine that searches the web *for* me, and provides me relevant sources to answer my question on top of summarizing it. Of course, It sometimes makes mistakes -- something I am wary of -- yet still, it is very nice to skip the task of searching for information from scratch myself.

The considerations I made, the thought I put into a search query in Google, refining it in my head, finding a balance between detailed and general, polishing my prose -- these are things I may never have to do again.

Is it a shame that I will lose those skills?

I notice a pattern in things that become easier -- automated, even.

The careful strokes of a fountain pen on paper, the writer writing with intent and forming loops, lines, and connections from letter to letter brings a whole new involvement into writing. The keyboard? Efficient, but decimates the experience.

Can we get down our thoughts faster? Yes. Are they as quality? Who knows, but it is certain an element of writing itself is lost.

Does someone want fast food prepared by a machine? Krabby-O-Mondays? Does someone want their words formed by a computer? "More and more people are using fountain pens nowadays to get that personal touch back"

Really?
