# Literature Reviews

## What is a literature review?

A literature is a review of the current "literature" of a particular topic. What does that mean? Suppose you are trying to figure out what is going on in the realm of unmanned aerial vehicle technology (UAVs). 

You might first do some heavy research to simply figure out what a UAV is in the first place

You might then delve into the history of UAVs, including why they came to be and their importance

From there, maybe you explain what UAVs do, what they're useful for, their applications, etc

Then perhaps you end off with current UAV technology, such as what UAVs are currently being used, what current technologies power UAVs, what components go into UAVs today, etc.

Then maybe you end off with with the things we don't yet know, and things humanity is currently striving towards in terms of UAV technology (one example would be how to create a UAV system that is completely autonomous, requiring absolutely zero human input).

That's it! You've basically read a whole heap of research papers on UAVs, and sort of collated them into one digestable paper told in the form of a story, from start to finish.

Being precise, a literature review is:

- A subjective overview of a particular topic
- Usually aims to answer some broad questions about the current literature, including the history of the topic, where we currently are, and any gaps/future directions for the topic
- Doesn't take too long to produce, a few weeks to a few months at most

## Why do we need literature reviews?

Literatures are very useful for familiarising yourself with a particular topic as it normally delves into the history of the topic, the current standing of the topic, and the future direction of the topic in a relatively short and digestible format.

It's also useful to identify any gaps in knowledge of a particular topic. When performing a literature review, you might have many questions that you never found the answers to in any of the papers that you read, indicating a potential gap in knowledge.

And finally as mentioned before already, it is very useful to know the future direction of a topic, which is mainly just understanding where the world wants to go with a particular thing. What barriers are yet to be broken? Stuff like that.

## Okay, so what is a systematic review then?

A systematic review has lots of similarities to a literature review with the key difference being that a systematic review specifically tries to answer a very precise question about a topic.

Remember that a literature review is just that -- a review. What is this topic? How did this all start? Where are we now? What stuff do we know/not know? What stuff do we want to do in the future.

A systematic review first asks a question, and then does a systematic search of all the literature to try and find an answer to that question. These questions are almost always ones that don't have a simple "yes" or "no" answer, thus necessitating the collation of many, *many* different research papers for an appropriate answer.

Systematic reviews normally take far longer to produce (from months to even a few years). Unlike literature reviews which can be produced by one person, a systematic review is normally carried out by multiple people to reduce bias.

# Seeking effectively 

When writing any academic paper, from a literature review to a systematic review to just a normal research paper, its important that you're able to find the information that you want on a library site. Throwing random search queries willy nilly might work, but its always better to follow some sort of search strategy to find relevant papers quickly. Here is one way to do it:

Once you have chosen a question(s) that you want to try and answer/get information on, identify the key words/acronyms first. An example question is given below:


<center> "Can UAVs be used as efficient delivery systems?" </center>

In this case, key words would probably be "UAVs" and "delivery system". Efficient definitely could be a key word, but efficiency isn't really describing a topic, and our search strategy will rely on this as we will see:

|          | Topic 1 | Topic 2         |
| -------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Keywords | UAVs    | Delivery system |

Now, lets start thinking of synonyms

|              | Topic 1                  | Topic 2          |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Keywords   → | UAVs                     | Delivery system  |
| Synonyms  ↓  | Unmanned Aerial Vehicles | Delivery service |
|              | Autopiloted Vehicles     | Courier          |

Once we are done thinking of all the synonyms that we can (these synonyms should still be close enough to the original meaning -- don't start chaining synonyms and ending up with a completely different meaning) we can then move onto our final step: forming some sort of search query. This is how it will work:

|              | Topic 1                  |     | Topic 2          |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | --- | ---------------- |
| Keywords   → | UAVs                     | AND | Delivery system  |
|              | OR                       |     | OR               |
| Synonyms  ↓  | Unmanned Aerial Vehicles | AND | Delivery service |
|              | OR                       |     | OR               |
|              | Autopiloted Vehicles     | AND | Courier          |

Our search query would be something like:

(UAVs **AND** (Delivery system **OR** Delivery service **OR** Courier))
**OR**
(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles **AND** (Delivery system **OR** Delivery service **OR** Courier))
**OR**
(Autopiloted Vehicles **AND** (Delivery system **OR** Delivery service **OR** Courier))

Depending on the service, you can easily just chuck this into the search bar and it will do the filtering for you. You can often use quotations around search parameters (e.g., putting "UAV" instead of just UAV in the search query) to specifically do string matching.

## Being wary of papers

You should be careful and critically analyse any paper you come across in terms of its potential bias, the credibility of the author, whether or not there are any sponsorships involved (which may introduce bias into the conclusion/results), how long ago it was published (perhaps the results would be outdated by now), and anything else that may impact the credibility, validity, reliability, precision, and accuracy of the paper. 

# Reading effectively

So now you know how to effectively search for papers that might be suitable for you to answer any research questions you might have, for performing a literature review, etc. It's more than likely that in your searching time, you will be presented with dozens of papers. Nobody really has time to sit and read through absolutely everything, so what should you do?

## Step 1

Before even reading the actual paper, always read the title, abstract, introduction (if its short enough -- some are very long) and conclusion to get an understanding of what the paper is about. At most, all of this combined is no more than a page/page and a half (which is far better than reading 25+ pages). 

Authors must always include an abstract for this very reason -- so that any passerby who sees the paper as potentially valuable for their goals doesn't have to waste their time reading the whole thing.

Once you've read those, and you've deemed that there is potentially valuable information that is relevant to your research goals, then you can start diving into the paper.

## Step 2

Take a deeper dive into the paper by reading the main bodies, top down. Don't worry too much on precise technical details for now, e.g., rigorous proofs or mathematical formulae. Just read, and take everything for what it is. Don't try and answer any questions you might have much for now, just read read read.

Write down notes for questions you will answer *later*. Trying to answer them now might lead you into a giant rabbit hole and distract you from the actual paper.

Write down the main points. What are the author(s) saying? What is their point here? What are some themes/patterns in the paper? What are things that are repeated?

Once you've done this and decided that there's definitely useful stuff in here, you can move onto the final step.

## Step 3

Read through the paper again, but this time try and answer any questions you had and try your best to understand the more technical side of things. Ideally, you should read as thoroughly as is necessary such that you could replicate what the author(s) did yourself.

## Being wary: part two

Again, as you're reading through the paper, you need to be wary of many things. 

- Is the author credible?
	- How do you know they're credible?
- Is the research old?
	- Might the results be outdated?
- Are there any sponsorships?
	- Could there be a financial incentive to skew results?
- Who is the audience?
	- Could there be, again, an incentive to skew results? Is this is a paper presented to a bunch of researchers, or silicon valley, make-billions-of-dollars-go-brrrrrrrrr people?
- Are the assumptions of the paper valid?
	- Could these assumptions have a carryover effect making the entire research invalid?
- Are the experimental practices sound?
	- Do the author(s), for example, properly control the independent variable? Are they introducing any bias in their results? Have they accounted for any errors?
- Do the author(s) acknolwedge any limitations?
	- If they don't, they either had no limitations (perhaps they did everything incredibly rigorously with decent funding or whatever) or they are intentionally hiding limitations for favorable results. Which is more likely in your case?
- Are the author(s) affiliated with any organisations?
	- Might this affect the results due to some sort of bias?

These are the main things you should be wary of, but there are plenty more. It's important to think critically, and question absolutely everything.

# Writing effectively

There are a few ways to help yourself begin writing a research paper, literature review, systematic review, research article, or whatever. Sometimes the amount of information you have on your hands is overwhelming, so it can help to follow some systematic processes.

## Mind mapping

This is quite simple. Let's take a look at one below

![[Pasted image 20241024215258.png]]

Once you have formed some sort of research question, you just start asking yourself questions about the question itself. First break up the research questions into its key words, and start drawing some connections. An easy target is when the word "better" or "enhance" or something alike comes up. You can always ask yourself "What do we mean by better? More efficient? Lower cost? More accessible? What?"

A mind map is less of a way to get you started writing, and more of a way to get you to really think about the topic you're considering by generating sub-questions which are a lot easier to answer, thereby hopefully setting you up with sufficient knowledge to finally start answering the research question that you started with. 

## Matrix/table

This is a nice way to see if the papers you have read answer any of the questions you had. Nobody is expecting you to memorize all the papers, and although after reading a bunch of papers you might have a much better idea of whats going on -- again -- nobody is expecting you to have memorized each and every little thing.

It is for this reason that a matrix/table that contains the paper you read, and specific answers to the questions you might have had can be very useful. You can use this table as the starting point for your actual writing. For example:

| Themes in research about PhD students                  | Hambug et all (2009)                  | Mewburn (2012)                                                                                         | Whathisname (2013)                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reasons for undertaking higher degree?                 | Argues that this varies by discipline | Argues that ther eis a clear gender division in the discipline enrollments -- but older people less so | Doesn't mention this -- many people don't, actually. Is this a problem with the literature? |
| Completion rates of PhD degrees?                       |                                       |                                                                                                        |                                                                                             |
| Social learning in PhD student communities?            |                                       |                                                                                                        |                                                                                             |
| Relationships with supervisors -- how important is it? |                                       |                                                                                                        |                                                                                             |

From this you can see how you might fill out the rest of the table. You can also of course include specific quotes from the author(s) or whatever else. This is just a neat way of laying out the crucial stuff that you want to answer, who said what, where they said it, if they said it at all, etc etc.

You can then start writing about particular things once you have filled out this table.


## Sentence Slashing/Sentence Skeletons

This is basically just using other good literature reviews, research papers, etc., as a skeleton for your writing. You might encounter beautifully formed sentences, and very concisely laid out paragraphs. You can just cut out the specific stuff, and use the sentences as a skeleton for your writing. For example, a lot of research papers and whatnot usually start off their abstract with something along the lines of:

"This study builds on and contributes to work in ... "

"In our study, we conducted an investigation on ``________``, seeing the effects of ... "

"This study analyses ``________``, its importance on society ... "

And more.
