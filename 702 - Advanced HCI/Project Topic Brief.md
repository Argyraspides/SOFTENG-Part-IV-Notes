## VR to Comprehend a War or Conflict Situation

- The project aims to explore the use of Virtual Reality (VR) in reducing conflicts and promoting understanding between different groups with differing perspectives.

- The increasing polarisation in the world has led to a lack of empathy and understanding, which can be addressed through immersive VR experiences that simulate different viewpoints.

- Previous research has shown that viewing a conflict scenario from an "outgroup" perspective can reduce moral judgment of one's own group's behaviour, suggesting that VR can promote understanding and empathy.

- The ultimate goal is to tap into the potential of VR to create an affective scenario to promote empathy and bring about understanding.

# PLAN
***
- Clarify your project topic: Your group's project topic is "VR to Comprehend a War or Conflict Situation". The goal is to explore using VR to reduce conflicts and promote understanding between groups with different perspectives.
~~- Search for relevant HCI articles:
    - Use databases like ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, etc. to find peer-reviewed HCI papers on VR for empathy/conflict understanding published since 2010.
    - Focus on finding 2 highly relevant articles that relate to your specific project goals.~~
- Read and take detailed notes on the 2 selected articles:
    - Summarize key points, methods, findings
    - Note how they relate to your project topic
    - Identify useful approaches or insights for your own project
- For the Literature Review Notes assignment:
    - Write an introduction summarizing how the literature relates to your project topic
    - Describe your methodology for finding the papers
    - Summarize the key points from each article, showing integrated understanding
    - Write a conclusion on the important takeaways and how they will influence your project
    - Include full ACM-style references
- For the Literature Review Slides assignment:
    - Create slides that briefly explain your project context
    - Describe the 2 articles and how they relate to each other
    - Summarize key insights and implications for your project
    - Include at least 2 relevant images per article
    - Ensure slides are visually appealing and appropriate for a 5-minute presentation
- Review the rubrics for each assignment to ensure you've met all the criteria.
