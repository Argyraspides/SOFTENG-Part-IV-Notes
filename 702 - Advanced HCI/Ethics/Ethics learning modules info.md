- Provide advice and assistance in regard to ethical principles.

- Provide an avenue for handling complaints or queries.

# What is the function of a human ethics committee?  

 **A human ethics committee will:**

- Review and where satisfied that it is appropriate, approve submitted research for compliance with ethical principles.

- Review and where satisfied that it is appropriate, approve submitted amendments to an approved study.

- Provide advice and assistance to anyone undertaking such research.

- Receive, record and respond to information concerning adverse events.

# Key Principles

  
_**To guide researchers in conducting their research to the highest ethical standards, the University acknowledges an ethics framework that encompasses two sets of principles sitting alongside each other.**_

-  The University’s [Taumata Teitei, Vision 2030 and Strategic plan 2025](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/about-us/about-the-university/the-university/official-publications/strategic-plan.html) expresses a commitment to fundamental Te Ao Māori principles and working in a way consistent with the emerging Waipapa framework. The principles reflect our foundational relationship with tangata whenua and commitment to Te Tiriti o Waitangi. Embedded in the framework is a commitment also to mana enhancing relationships, represented as ‘Kia whakamana i te tangata’:
- **Manaakitanga:** Caring for those around us in the way we relate to each other
- **Whanaungatanga:** Recognising the importance of kinship and lasting relationship
- **Kaitiakitanga:** Valuing stewardship and guardianship and our relationship with the natural world

**Te Ara Tika** is a framework for researchers and ethics committee members developed by the Pūtaiora Writing Group with support from the National Ethics Advisory Committee (NEAC), the Health Research Council (HRC), and Ngā Pae o te Māramatanga (NPM). Te Ara Tika principles are drawn from tikanga Māori (Māori protocols and practices) and its philosophical base of mātauranga Māori (traditional knowledge), and integrate understandings from Te Tiriti o Waitangi, Indigenous values and Western ethical principles.

Alongside the **tikanga principles** is a set of Western **bioethics principles** shaped over many years in response to international events impacting research and the ethics landscape.

**The value underlying these principles is respect for people.**


# Manaakitanga

Manaakitanga refers to caring for others, nurturing relationships and being careful in the way we treat others. Aroha (respect, love), generosity, sharing and hosting are essential to manaakitanga, as is upholding the mana of all parties. As well as gathering data, researchers should collaborate with and give back to the community (for example, through koha and sharing ideas).

# Mana

Mana refers to power, prestige, leadership or authority bestowed, gained or inherited individually or collectively. It infers that each individual has the right to determine their own destiny upon their own authority.

# Whakapapa

Whakapapa refers to relationships: the quality of relationships and the structures or processes that have been established to support these relationships. The relationship between researchers and participants (and New Zealand communities) must involve trust, respect and integrity.


# Tika

Tika refers to what is right and what is good for any particular situation. Importantly, in the context of ethics it relates to the design of a study, and whether the research achieves proposed outcomes, benefits participants and communities and brings about positive change.

Tika requires respectful relationships with Māori in all studies, regardless of the research design and methods. Researchers should engage with communities about which research questions are important, and reflect on the ethical issues associated with their study.



# Respect for people

This principle is frequently phrased as respect for autonomy, but is wider in that it also encompasses respect and protection for people who may not be capable of exercising full autonomy.  It requires that research participants’ capacity for self- determination is treated with respect. Participants should freely consent to their participation in the research study and their consent should be informed by relevant information provided by the researchers. Autonomy may also refer to the autonomy of  groups in society.

# Non-Maleficence

Researchers have a duty to consider the harm that their research project might cause. Research should minimise and manage risks of harm, such as the risk of physical or psychological harm to research participants or researchers. The greater the risk of harm that might result from the research study, the greater the care that should be taken when addressing the ethical issues raised. 


#  Beneficence

The principle of beneficence is about acting for the good (benefit) of others, both as individuals and groups, and includes acting for the public good Researchers should consider how their research study might be of benefit to participants, groups and/or wider society. There may be direct benefits to the participant, for example through the intervention they receive, or to wider society through the results of the research.

# Justice

Justice is about treating others equitably and distributing burdens and benefits fairly. Researchers have a duty to ensure that the benefits of their research are achieved through just means; that the benefits and burdens of research are fairly distributed; and that there is fair treatment in the recruitment of participants.
