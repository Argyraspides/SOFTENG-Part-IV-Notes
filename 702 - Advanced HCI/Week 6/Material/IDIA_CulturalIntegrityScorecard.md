# Cultural Integrity Scorecard

We're regularly asked by organisations to help make their brand, product or service more indigenous or culturally appropriate. Usually these organisations are looking to differentiate themselves and showcase their uniqueness through an association with New Zealand's MƒÅori culture. These conversations always require more exploration and discussion for everyone to understand what this really means - for the organisation and the people whose culture they're using.

We created this scorecard to help people start conversations, assess intentions and truly understand the cultural integrity of their work.

## Cultural Integrity Questions

### Authenticity
