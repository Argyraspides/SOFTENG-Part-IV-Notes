#### Random shit he said that aren't in the slides + group discussions
- Should be using "key success factors" and not "critical success factors" even tho they're interchangable

- Stakeholders pay a lot of money for consulting when they wanna try and solve a particular problem. 
	- When confronting wicked problems, stakeholders will have conflicting interests and goals. Despite the fact that, indeed, wicked problems are ***unsolvable, undefinable, unverifiable, unique, and uncertain***, we still must do our best to break the problem down into smaller problems that *are* solvable or at the very least improvable.

- Innovation can be incremental, evolutionary, or revolutionary 

- Ways to come up with ideas:
	- Split into smaller groups & brainstorm
		- Split these groups according to some criteria, e.g. keep groups with a bunch of specs or smth or maybe have groups only have one spec
	- Brain dump into some document
	- Simple discussion with the whole group
