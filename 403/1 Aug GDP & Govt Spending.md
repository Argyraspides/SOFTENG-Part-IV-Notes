- The "Meadows" book or something talks about how we operate within a system of systems (slide "The Systems Level" showing the environment, society, and economy)
	- When we are considering a systems level challenge, we are faced with systems OF systems.
		- One of those systems are the economy. Another is society itself.

- Sometimes it's hard to make a judgement on GDP, e.g. if you pay 10$ a month for Spotify to listen to millions of songs vs buying a bunch of records for individual songs (and you'll never buy millions of records,) even though the Spotify subscription is FAR cheaper per song than buying a bunch of records (meaning it contributes less to the GDP and thus the "economic health" of the country) but this doesnt suddenly mean that Spotify is "ruining the economy!! Everyone should start buying records instead to increase the GDP!!!" 

- Two quarters of negative GDP growth is considered a recession
	- If your GDP is increasing at a slower rate than inflation is making the dollar worth less, then your GDP is still going backwards technically even though the absolute value may be going up

- Kate Raworth talked about the doughnut/donut economy/economics.
	- Slide 23:
		- The challenge for any economy is to remain in the donut (green part.) If you push beyond it, you "compromise some fundamental natural systems." For example if you bring in lots of money by logging, then if your short sighted money hungry brain kills all the trees then you're fucked (you've gone past the green donut.) At the same time if you don't log enough, then not enough money is being made for the economy and your society begins to hate you, leading to a revolution and the invasion of the sea peoples.
