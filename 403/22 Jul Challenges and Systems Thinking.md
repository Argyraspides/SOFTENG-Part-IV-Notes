This course is meant to be regurgitory in nature, requiring no thinking and instead applying anecdotal and poorly referenced concepts for the quizzes and tests. Here are some definitions:

### What is a system?
"Okay. And so when we think about a system, the key aspects of, uh, making it a system are that has elements. So in other words, there are various things that are components of the system. There's interconnections or relationships between those elements and that the system serves a purpose. Okay. So that's really the test of whether or not something is in something is a system."

#### Simple & Complex Systems
Simple systems are usually based on cause-effect relationships. Everything is quite linear ("single-threaded") and "obvious"
- The approach to understand these systems is to categorize aspects of it. An example of a simple system is given below

![[Pasted image 20240725155343.png]]

Complex systems also have cause-effect relationships, but they require a higher level of expertise to understand and analyze. With the case above with the system that turns rotational motion into linear motion, you don't really need to be a rocket scientist to figure things out. From the diagram alone, you can easily figure out what is going on (a simple system.) A complex system may be something like a nuclear reactor:

![[Pasted image 20240725155629.png]]

While the flow is simple, understanding what's actually happening requires specialized knowledge of chemistry. Most people without any knowledge of engineering could look at the simple system above and get an intuition of what its doing (translating rotational motion into linear motion,) but would be hardpressed to know what the hell is going on with the complex system (nuclear reactor.)

With complex systems, the approach to understand them is usually to analyze it and see how the different parts work together, rather than mere categorization as is done with simple systems. 

Complex systems also have "best practices," as there are usually tens, hundreds, or even thousands of ways to make it. Because there is no one way to make these complex systems, you can't have a rigid set of rules on how to make them. Instead, you have "best practice," or a set of general guidelines to follow that if followed will ensure the complex system you make will work well.

#### More on Complex Systems

Complex systems by nature are nonlinear, meaning that the parts that work together to form cause-effect relationships are branched and can operate in many combinations with one another.

To understand the ... effects of complex systems on the world we have to probe their behavior? Or are we probing the complex system itself? Or a part of it? So fuckin ambiguous this guy. I'm assuming he means systems that we have developed ourselves but are so complex that we cannot reliably predict their behavior as they operate in the real world. The economy is an example of this. *We* are the ones who came up with an economic system, how things should be traded, how money should flow, etc -- but we cannot reliably know what this system will do over time (e.g. what is going to happen to house prices in 2 years? What will the inflation rate look like in 5 years time? What will the price of socks be 10 years down the line?) We know *how* it works, *why* it works, but we cannot know *what* will happen with a high degree of certainty the same way that we can be absolutely certain that a solar eclipse will occur (Newtonian mechanics is a "simple system" in that regard.)

Complex systems have large numbers of interacting elements
Microscopic changes within the system can lead to hugely different outcomes (think the butterfly effect)
They are highly dynamic and solutions to fix the system can't be sought out as the system is too complex to reliably predict what will happen. Instead, problems must arise through emergence and *then* solutions can be made.
#### Wicked Problems
Wicked problems occur when stakeholders have diverging values, and hence desire different things from a particular complex system. Because the system is complex, and we don't have omniscience over how it operates, nobody really wins and it becomes a constant tug and war of balance. E.g., New Zealanders want cheap dairy, and maybe this requires expanding farmland to increase livestock. However, increasing farmland conflicts with the interest of Maori who have sacred sites that must be protected, all the meanwhile the logistics and engineering challenges that engineers have to deal with with making increased livestock production efficient, OR if farmland were to remain as is -- increasing milk production in a way that doesn't torture cows or reduce the quality of the milk or whatever means that all parties involved are in a constant battle with each other and themselves. This isn't a problem per se, but if animosity begins to develop amongst everyone involved *then* we have a wicked problem.


### Iceberg Model
Another fancy term to justify spending 2000 dollars on this course. It just means "there's more than meets the eye." I.e. that we only see the surface of all things, and to understand a problem and why it emerges we must go deeper than simply how it presents itself (which is usually an event.)

![[Pasted image 20240725162751.png]]

The event level is how we perceive the world. What we first see, hear, feel, touch, taste, etc.

The pattern level is where we begin to notice commonalities and patterns within these events. E.g. maybe this event is happening all over the place

The structure level is the structure that actually causes the pattern. For example, if you notice (event) that everyone is getting sick (pattern,) you might conclude that the reason is because there is a virus spreading (structure (not the virus, but the act of it spreading, is the structure))

The mental model level is the attitude, beliefs, morals, expectations, and values that allow structures to continue functioning as they do. In the virus case, it may be because the mental model of the society allows for unsanitary practices.


## Tools of Exploration
Use these in conjunction with one another to really figure out a system to its fullest extent. From an ant colony to the world economy.

### System Models
Basically any wishy washy loosey goosey diagram that tries to illustrate a system at work. There still has to be some structure but for the most part (as the lecturer described and presented it) it's doing nothing more but showing "flow" of a system. I guess anyone should be able to look at the system and walk away with a high level overview of how it works. Here is one for the carbon cycle:

![[Pasted image 20240731234849.png | 500]]

### Causal Loops
The diagram above (carbon cycle) you can see has a loop -- but it's a "vanilla" feedback loop, not really a *causal* one. A causal loop in particular has the following information:

- Variables
- Links between variables
- Signs on the links 
- Sign of the loop itself

![[Pasted image 20240801001954.png | 800]]
Here is a causal loop of money in a bank account that has interest. If you put money in the bank, then you earn some interest -- which means more money, and more money means more interest *earned* which means more money in the bank which means ...

This is a positive feedback loop (hence the + signs,) and the "R" means "Reinforcement," indicating this is a reinforcement loop.

![[Pasted image 20240801001733.png | 800]]
In this new case above, stress causes the number of coping strategies to increase. An increase in the use of coping strategies means the stress goes down. If the stress goes down then so does the use of coping strategies, meaning stress goes back up again (and so on and so forth ...)

This is a balancing feedback loop, hence the "B" in the middle.


### Leverage Points
This just means points where you can change the system entirely. E.g., to lower the carbon footprint we could have people consume less meat. We could either come up with a perfect, plant-based fake meat that has all of the nutrients and perfectly matches the original flavor, cooking behaviors, etc, but this requires a lot of research, engineering, etc. OR we could have all of society change their mindset about meat eating. The latter is a lot harder, but is a point of leverage to combat the problem (the former is lettings things be as they are, and coming up with a solution not expecting the system itself to change)

### "Application of Approach" as I observed it:

- Define the problem ("Dissatisfaction with NZ Healthcare System" -- the event, per se) 
	- Dive deep into the patterns of this problem (which according to some report ended up being **limited access** to healthcare and **waitlist** times)
	- Then, identify the reasons/factors/problems/whatever contributing to these larger problems of limited access and waitlist times:
		- **Waitlist**: She showed something along the lines of a bunch of smaller problems/reasons/factors contributing to the "waitlist problem,":  overloaded doctors -> covid pauses -> reliance on emergency systems -> worsening patient conditions -> ageing population ... lack of staff -> everyone going to aussie -> back to overloaded doctors
		- **Access**: Same as above

Also throughout all this ask yourself if there are any points of leverage.

E.g. for waitlist problem:

Notice how each thing (e.g. "Better pay overseas") is a mini-problem that we could potentially focus on to solve the problem

Then all of that turns into this:

![[Pasted image 20240801004729.png | 1000]]

These are our problem spaces that we can start tackling one by one. In the case above, four were identified as actual smaller subproblems that could potentially be tackled. For each of these, come up with a problem statement:
