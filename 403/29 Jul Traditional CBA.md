#### Shit he said that aint on the slides:
If a project is big enough and risky enough you must follow the Better Business Case
- What is defined as "big" and "risky"?

- For "Only those directly related to the project" on slide 13 he means try not to go ham on flow-on benefits/drawbacks on the wider world. Two degrees separation at most (i.e. if you're talking about benefits to solving traffic congestion, dont go down a rabbit hole like oh man this means bigger roads which means less traffic which means DRIVERS CAN SEE KIDS ON THE ROAD EASIER AND AVOID ACCIDENTS :DDD like thats not related lol to traffic congestion)

- For "Should include costs and benefits that are avoided due to the decisions being made about the project" He gave an example of a bridge thats old and completely fucked and the maintenance costs are high due to its age, and while building a brand new bridge would be more expensive *now* the maintenance costs would be fuck all compared to the old ass bridge which is a cost that is avoided and could be a really good justification for the project.

- PBE stands for "Program Business case Estimation"
	- A program is a series of large projects. E.g., the CRL (city rail link) is a project (or "systems project") that exists within the KiwiRail Programme for Auckland. The KiwiRail Programme for Auckland which they call ("Auckland Rail Programme") just consists of a bunch of projects.
- IBE stands for "Indicative Business case Estimation"
- DBE stands for "Detailed Business case Estimation"
- PE stands for ???

- "Statistically, P50 and P90 represent **the confidence level of a cost not being exceeded**. A P50 value has a 50% probability that it will be exceeded, whereas, a P90 only has a 10% probability of being exceeded."
	- How do you measure this probability lmao

- NPV -- make sure you discount back to the net present value 


"Remember bottom up versus top down. Top down quite difficult for a lot of these projects. Try to build from bottom up. Try to build what the components are of that project and then to try and find costs for those individual pieces. So you might not be able to just find, you know, what's the cost of building five train stations. But you might be able to find, okay, there's this case in Amsterdam that had similar, um, you know, similar city, similar layout, similar ground type geo techniques. So that would cost this much to build this type of station. And then how many of those stations do you need? Are they of similar scope? And *then* you can build from the bottom up going top down."

 "So taking into account inflation and the multiplier effect should be ignored.So sometimes you could say that oh we've got this project that's going to employ a thousand people here. Those people are going to spend money at local businesses, quite common in events. But we ignore those in these terms because that resource is going to come from somewhere else. So it's the government. It's net zero, okay. That resource is coming from somewhere else and it's taking away that spending from somewhere else. So from the government's point of view, remember the whole country, it's net zero. It's not going to provide any more benefit. And in fact it balances out with the benefit taken away from workers in certain areas. The only time that that's not the case is when there's high unemployment, which means that you're taking people that are potentially unemployed and you're making them employed. That is a benefit. Okay. Leave that there."

For economic metrics (slide 33) make sure you take in ALL metrics into consideration. For example, NPV will always favor the project with the highest value simply due to how the equation works. You must also take into account CBR.
