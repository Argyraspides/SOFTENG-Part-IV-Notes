GNH was made by bhutan 
- apparently being picked up by more and more countries
- been adopted by the UN

generally all of the wellbeing frameworks around the world follow the same kind of template:
- whats happening with everyone individually (e.g. health), with their surroundings (e.g. family, relationships, services), and what is happening with the collective country (employment rate, housing prices, e.g.)

apparently the treasury looked at GNH and found criteria was too subjective and hard to measure and said fuck that lets make our own shit

remember LSF is a FRAMEWORK whereas the UNSDG are GOALS. They cannot be used interchangeably, however you can use the LSF framework to try and achieve the UNSDG

he ara waiora was developed by the NZ treasury
