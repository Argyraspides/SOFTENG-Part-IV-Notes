First half is just recap from 22 jul

Process to solving a problem:

- Explore the problems iceberg. The problem itself and how it manifests itself in the form of the events isn't everything. Resist the urge to come up with solutions. Actually try and understand the patterns, structure, and nature of the problem.
- Identify the users and stakeholders 
	- Determine their requirements
	- Select the key success factors (the shit that you MUST hit for the solution -- this will be based on the problem itself as well as the needs of the users and stakeholders)
	- Come up with OPTIONS for potential solutions (longer list)
		- Test these options against the key success factors
			- Whichever ones stand the test will go into the refined "short list" of potential solutions
				- Carry out an economic and societal impact analysis for each of these potential solutions
		- Determine which one of the shortlisted solutions will create the most VALUE and then suggest it as the way forward
- At last come up with a plan to implement the solution

Remember always try and look at problems in terms of the iceberg model, the bathtub theorem when coming up with problem spaces.

Always try and see if you can create system models, causal loops to see how the problem fits/acts/behaves in this system (remember that our problems arise from the systems we create.) From these systems see if you can identify any points of leverage, etc.

Remember to not only test your solutions against key success factors, but also your solution should ideally be desireable, feasible, viable, and sustainable.

that was fuckin it
