GDP is all around us. It's cars, clothes, doctors, hairdressersâ€”even it's all part of GDP. Let me explain: some people produce goods like cars or clothes; others produce services like doctors or hairdressers. So, if you add up the value of goods and services, you get Gross Domestic Product. Or you can add up income. If you add up the income of all the United States in one year, you get US GDP. So, a higher GDP means everyone's doing great, right? Not always.

You see, GDP doesn't measure, for example, how things are being distributed. Some people may be getting all of this income, or how much of the environment is being damaged. A lot of cars may mean a lot of pollution. In fact, GDP doesn't even include some very important services, like child care. Has a babysitter looked after your younger brother for the day? They get an income; they're providing a service. But if your mom did the same exact thing and looked after your younger brother, she doesn't get an income, so it's not included in GDP. So, GDP is known to measure a very important service, but GDP is a good overall indication of how much an economy produces every year. So that's GDP. It's all around us, and it's very good to know.
