## Why do we need to host the America's cup in the first place? What's the point?

- Attracts lots of international visitors (almost 40,000 during the 46th Cup) [0](https://aucklandunlimited.com/news/reports-reveal-results-of-auckland-and-new-zealands-hosting-of-the-36th-americas-cup)
	- Despite covid, the Cup created almost 300 million NZD in expenditure in Auckland alone. [0](https://aucklandunlimited.com/news/reports-reveal-results-of-auckland-and-new-zealands-hosting-of-the-36th-americas-cup)
		- Supports local businesses, creates jobs (usually contract roles)
- 89% of attendees said AC36 increased their pride (untangible economic value) [0](https://aucklandunlimited.com/news/reports-reveal-results-of-auckland-and-new-zealands-hosting-of-the-36th-americas-cup)
- 85% of attendees said it made Auckland more enjoyable to live in (untangible economic value) [0](https://aucklandunlimited.com/news/reports-reveal-results-of-auckland-and-new-zealands-hosting-of-the-36th-americas-cup)
	- Attendees are only a fraction of Auckland's population, though. Most people probs don't care about the event. 
- Incentive to upgrade old infrastructure & build new infrastructure. Potential reuse in the future for many different events. [0](https://aucklandunlimited.com/news/reports-reveal-results-of-auckland-and-new-zealands-hosting-of-the-36th-americas-cup)

- The marine industry in NZ makes absolute bank. A lot more superyachts visit NZ during these events and pay a hefty amount of money for fuel, berthing, repairs, etc [3](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/416052/covid-19-sails-off-with-nz-s-america-s-cup-income#:~:text=%22Its%20amazing%20the%20amount%20of,million%20worth%20of%20service%20work%2C). Also creates jobs and stirs up economic activity. NZ lost out on 150 million dollars in revenue when ~50 superyachts pulled out of visiting NZ shores in 2020 [3](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/416052/covid-19-sails-off-with-nz-s-america-s-cup-income#:~:text=%22Its%20amazing%20the%20amount%20of,million%20worth%20of%20service%20work%2C) 

- According to [2](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/464261/team-new-zealand-s-decision-to-host-america-s-cup-in-spain-disappointing-for-auckland-mayor-says), a good chunk of the expense of hosting the events goes to engineers n shit for building cracked sailboats. This tech naturally trickles down into the industry and makes NZ goated at building boats therefore $BANK

## Why did team NZ reject the offer from the government to host the competition in Auckland?
- *"Representatives of the Team New Zealand Board have informed the Crown-Council negotiators that the offer is not sufficient," America's Cup Minister Stuart Nash said today [1](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/americas-cup-team-nz-rejects-government-auckland-council-hosting-bid/6K4LEVFZI34OE6IZ5UX5MPVD3Q/).*

## Why was the offer not sufficient? How much money is actually needed to host? What expenses are involved?
- *"Team New Zealand boss Grant Dalton told Morning Report there simply was not enough money invested into holding the event in Auckland to cover costs, and only about a third of what was promised was tangible cash for them. [2](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/464261/team-new-zealand-s-decision-to-host-america-s-cup-in-spain-disappointing-for-auckland-mayor-says)"

- *"You are not going to do if you are short on money, and money equates to people. Team New Zealand are a technology company - if you break it down, that's what they are, it's design, engineering and carbon fibre-building and composites." [2](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/464261/team-new-zealand-s-decision-to-host-america-s-cup-in-spain-disappointing-for-auckland-mayor-says)*

- *"Those people don't come cheap and Dalton was telling me a couple of days ago there is a shortage of let's call them sailing scientists, that is the engineers, designers and builders. To retain those people and to create an environment where they can strut their stuff, you need funding. [2](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/464261/team-new-zealand-s-decision-to-host-america-s-cup-in-spain-disappointing-for-auckland-mayor-says)"*

- *"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she was disappointed ... the decision did not reflect New Zealand's capacity to host large sporting events, she added. She noted the country was at present hosting the Women's Cricket World Cup, and would soon be hosting the Fifa Women's World Cup - two major international tournaments. [2](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/464261/team-new-zealand-s-decision-to-host-america-s-cup-in-spain-disappointing-for-auckland-mayor-says)"*

- Since they accepted Barcelona's offer then ig this means that at minimum they can get by with 120 million NZD.

## If the "benefits outweigh the costs" according to [4](https://www.majorevents.govt.nz/dmsdocument/4794-36th-americas-cup-high-level-economic-assessment-evaluation-2017) why DIDN'T the NZ government increase its offer? 

- *"We were not going to spend more of our ratepayers' money than what was on the table, we thought we gave a fair deal to Team New Zealand ... but clearly, it wasn't enough." [2](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/464261/team-new-zealand-s-decision-to-host-america-s-cup-in-spain-disappointing-for-auckland-mayor-says)*
	- Also no guarantee that 99 million dollars would be enough anyways. Costs are always hard to estimate.

- *"Enough money was put on the table for it to be hosted locally, and Team New Zealand's leaders made a different decision, Ardern said." [2](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/464261/team-new-zealand-s-decision-to-host-america-s-cup-in-spain-disappointing-for-auckland-mayor-says)*

- According to [4](https://www.majorevents.govt.nz/dmsdocument/4794-36th-americas-cup-high-level-economic-assessment-evaluation-2017) even though the benefits outweigh the costs, the margin's weren't really that great (-2 million to +76 million NZD benefit.) This coupled with the fact that estimations are almost always incorrect meant they probs werent willing to take the risk.

## So, then, how can we incentivize Emirates Team NZ to host the cup here?

Ideas:

- BRING BACK THE MINISTRY OF WORKS?

- Start selling goated NZ boats with that juicy innovation from the highly competitive Cup for some $ $ $ $ $?

- Make some tourism propaganda for the rest of the world? Give NZ the image of being the Colosseum for sailing? (this would be a point of leverage)
	- Do this and get international businesses interested and get them to invest?
	- Year-round sailing events? Do some epic shit every year and establish a calendar of international sailing events to maintain NZ's profile as a premier sailing destination
		- Make a bunch of TikTok's or some shit of NZ sailors going on an epic Pacific Ocean quest and fake it (Mr Beast style) to attract attention and make money. All hardships of the sea should be conquered and NZ should be glorified as the home of the greatest sailors to ever live.
