Suppose I want to predict how many ice creams people will buy given the temperature of the day.

$t = Temperature$
$i = Number \space of \space ice \space creams$

And let's say I found a neat little function that works (it predicts ice cream sales really well!) that outputs the $i$ given $t$.

$i = f(t)$ 

This is linear regression: predicting the value of a variable (the dependent) based on another variable (the independent)

In this case, the number of ice creams is the dependent variable, and the temperature an independent variable.

### Example:

Above we are attempting to predict peoples happiness, $y$, depending on their income, $x$.

Here, the independent variable is income, and happiness the dependent.
