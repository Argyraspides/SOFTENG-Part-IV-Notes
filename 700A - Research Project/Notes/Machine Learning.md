“Programming computers so they can learn from data” / “Allow computers to learn without explicitly being programmed”

Machine learning is a way for a computer to make decisions, predictions (i.e. any sort of conclusion) based on data. A computing device will be given data, and based on that data will extrapolate certain conclusions by learning about it. The way it “interprets” data will be programmed via various algorithms, however the conclusions that it draws (or rather outputs that it gives, to be more precise) will be almost independent. I say almost because the way in which these models are programmed will in some way influence the way the computer learns and interacts with the data and hence the outputs it provides, however the point is that the outputs it gives are independent in that they require no further input from us humans. We simply program the model, give it data, and let it fly.
- What is leveraged here is being able to find deep, embedded patterns in particular datasets, especially very large ones full of complexity in order to predict certain outcomes that we humans would never be able to see given the expansiveness and complexity of the dataset making the underlying patterns incredibly difficult to see.
