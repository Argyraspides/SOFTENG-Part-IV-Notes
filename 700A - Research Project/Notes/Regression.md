Regression is the simple statistical procedure of attempting to predict the value of one variable based on another (e.g. predicting the number of ice cream sales depending on the temperature of the day.) The simplest form of regression is [[Linear Regression|linear regression]] because it's just a line g. You can of course go as hogwild as you want and have some insane functions to try and predict something.

An example of linear regression (just a line g):
