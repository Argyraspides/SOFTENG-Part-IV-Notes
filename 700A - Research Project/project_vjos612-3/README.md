In the root directory, the MLP and SVM python files are self explanatory -- they contain the python code that trains a multi-layered 
perceptron model as well as the support vector machine model for multi-classification. 

You will also find "mlp_model.joblib" and "svm_model.joblib" in the "archives" folder in the root directory, which are the fully trained 
models in serialized form (the final ones at the end of tweaking through cross validation), which you may use to conduct your own tests 
upon the code whilst skipping the training steps.

There is also a PDF file in the root directory which is the phase 1 project report.
